WP Bit.ly uses the Bit.ly API to generate short links for all of your posts and pages. Statistics are displayed for each link from the dashboard.

== Description ==

WP Bit.ly allows you to generate short links using the Bit.ly API for all of your blogs posts and pages.

The generated short links can than be used by you, your visitors and a variety of other services that employ them. Using shortcode or PHP template tags, the short links can than be displayed directly on your pages so that people can use them for bookmarks, email, twitter, or other social media sites to link back to your pages.

Future development will include the ability to use your own domain as the short link (http://yourdomain.com/bXhGjs).

Features of the current version also include the generation of a new meta box on your posts that show you statistics about your link. In addition to a regular statistics plugin you can use this plugin to see who's clicking on your links!

== Installation ==

Manual installation:

1. Upload the `wp-bitly` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

Installation using "Add New Plugin"

1. From your Admin UI (Dashboard), use the menu to select Plugins -> Add New
2. Search for 'WP Bitly'
3. Click the 'Install' button to open the plugin's repository listing
4. Click the 'Install' button

Configuration:

1. Navigate to Dashboard -> Settings -> Writing to configure your Bit.ly username and API key.
2. Select the post types for which Bit.ly shortlinks should be used

Note: I intend to move Plugin settings to Settings -> Permalinks, once <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9296">this bug is fixed</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installation, do I need to update all my posts for short links to be created? =

No, shortlinks are generated by filtering the core get_shortlink() function.

= What happens if I change a posts permalink? =

WP Bit.ly validates all short links whenever you update a post, so if you change the permalink or location of the post, your old short link will be replaced with a new one.

= Does WP Bit.ly conform to the HTML/HTTP shortlink specification? =

With help from the new WordPress 3.0 Shortlink API, WP Bit.ly conforms with the specification by not only inserting the appropriate meta element in each of your pages, but also the HTTP headers.

= How do I include the short links using WordPress shortcode? =

The WP Bit.ly shortcode for including short links directly in your posts is quite simply [wpbitly]. This shortcode will also accept the same arguments that you can pass to the_shortlink(), including 'text', 'title', 'before' and 'after'.

= How do I include the short links using PHP? =

If you are using WordPress 3.0 (remember to upgrade!) all you have to do is include a call to the_shortlink() anywhere in your theme or plugin.
